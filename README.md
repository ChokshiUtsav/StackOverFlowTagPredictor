# StackOverFlowTagPredictor
Problem Statement:
The question answering site Stack Overflow allows users to assign tags to questions in order to make them easier for other people to find. In this project we aim to develop a predictor that is able to assign tags based on the content of a question.

Motivation:
Manual tagging by users generally works well for experienced users, it can be challenging for inexperienced users to find appropriate tags for their question. Also letting users add new tags it is likely that different users use different orthographic versions of tags that mean the same thing such as “php5” and “php- 5”. 
For these reasons it is desirable to a have a system that is able to either automatically tag questions or to suggest relevant tags to a user based on the question content
